# Coffee Sales Analysis

## Project Background
Brew Coffee, an international coffee company founded in 2019, specializes in selling various types of coffee beans such as Excelsa, Arabica, Robusta, and Liberica. The company has asked for insights and to deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, products, and their loyalty program.

## Executive Summary
Coffee Brew's sales analysis of over 1,000 record across 2019-2022 shows annual revenue stabilizing around () with the United States contributing 78% of total sales. The coffee beans come in 4 types with 3 different roast types with Exelsa as the highest performing coffee type. The loyalty program seems to be underperforming, but Coffee Brew can capitilize on the recent 36% increase in orders with loyalty signup offers. Coffee Brew can benefit from optimizing their loyalty program specific to each country, expanding bundles with high performing products, and reducing focus on underperforming regions and product lines. Targeted customer retention in Ireland and a continued primary focus on the US can drive sustainable and predictable growth.

- Non-loyalty AOV decreased over 9% in 2021 while loyalty members stayed consistent (1.7% increase).

# Recommendations: 
**Scale High-Performing Products:** Focus on top sellers like Excelsa Light and Arabica Medium which consistently lead in revenue and order volume. Consider using them in bundles and in new-customer offers to drive repeat interest. 

**Reconsider Low Performers:** Products like Robusta Dark and Medium underperform in both AOV and revenue. Reevaluate the price of these products or bundle them with other items to increase sales. 

### Country Level Growth Optimization

**Invest in the US Market:** With 78.6% of total sales and growth in AOC and order count, the US should be the primary focus. Continue to focus on the US by updating the loyalty program, focusing on Q4 promotions to capitalize on the surge, and new products specific to the US.

**Capture Ireland’s New Customers:** In 2021, Ireland showed 60%+ increase in order volume, but a 24% drop in AOV. Take advantage of the increase in new customers by trying to convert them to loyalty members. The drop in AOV might suggest price sensitivity, so consider loyalty conversion offers and discounts after spending thresholds. 

**Reassess UK Strategy:** With a 40% sales decrease in 2021 and consistent low sales, the UK may need a complete strategy reconstruction. Reduce spending or consider new strategies centered around the annual spike in March. Consider loyalty offers or bundles in Q1 before fully scaling back. 

### Loyalty Program Enhancements:

**Drive Loyalty Growth:** Loyalty customer order count has remained flat for three years. Incentivize more orders with spending goals, birthday rewards, or frequent offers.

**Boost AOV:** Although similar in 2021, loyalty AOV has been lower than non loyalty AOV overall. Incentivize bigger orders through the loyalty program such as discounts on orders $50+ or discounts on big bundles of items.

**Convert Non Loyalty Users:** With the recent 36% order growth in 2021, there is an opportunity to capture these new customers with the loyalty program. Leverage post-purchase loyalty sign ups or offers specific to returning customers to bring repeat purchases. 

**Specialize Loyalty Program:** Each country has different seasonality when it comes to sales. Utilize this by aligning offers with seasonality. The UK can focus on customer retention with the sales spike in March, and the US can address slower summer months with special offers and capitalize on Q4 surge.
