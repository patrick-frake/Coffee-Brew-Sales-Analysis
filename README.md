The coffee beans come in 4 types with 3 different roast types with Exelsa as the highest performing coffee type. The loyalty program seems to be underperforming, but Coffee Brew can capitilize on the recent 36% increase in orders with loyalty signup offers.

Targeted customer retention in Ireland and a continued primary focus on the US can drive sustainable and predictable growth.
